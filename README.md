# 🚀 Abu Huraira's Portfolio 2026

Welcome to the digital abode of my code! This isn't just a repository; it's a window into the future (specifically, 2026).

## 🧐 What's Inside?

*   **Pixels with Personality**: UI so smooth it might just slide off your screen.
*   **Code with Character**: Logic that (mostly) defies the laws of bugs.
*   **Caffeine-Powered Creations**: Built with high-grade coffee and late-night inspiration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack of Destiny

*   **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Because we like our backends robust and our frontends razor-sharp.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3**: The bread and butter, but toasted to perfection.
*   **JavaScript**: Adding that sprinkle of magic interacting with the DOM.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1.  Clone this bad boy.
2.  Open in your favorite IDE (VS Code, Visual Studio, or a magnetized needle and a steady hand).
3.  Run it and watch the magic happen.

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? It's a "surprise feature." But feel free to open an issue or PR if you want to squash it!
